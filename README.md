Overview

This Python project simulates a probability experiment using a virtual "hat" filled with colored balls. The purpose is to estimate the likelihood of drawing a specific combination of balls from the hat without replacement, by running repeated randomized experiments (Monte Carlo method).

This project is a great practice in working with Python classes, randomness, deep copying, and basic probability concepts.

ðŸ§¾ Features

Define a custom hat containing any number of balls by color.

Randomly draw a given number of balls without replacement.

Run multiple experiments to estimate the probability of drawing certain combinations.

Uses Monte Carlo simulation to approximate outcomes
